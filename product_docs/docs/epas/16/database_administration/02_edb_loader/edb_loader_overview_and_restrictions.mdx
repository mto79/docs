description: "Provides an overview of the key features of EDB*Loader as well as important compatability information"
---

EDB\*Loader features include:

-   Support for the Oracle SQL\*Loader data loading methods (conventional path load, direct path load, and parallel direct path load)
-   Syntax for control file directives compatible with Oracle SQL\*Loader
-   Input data with delimiter-separated or fixed-width fields
-   Bad file for collecting rejected records
-   Loading of multiple target tables
-   Discard file for collecting records that don't meet the selection criteria of any target table
-   Log file for recording the EDB\*Loader session and any error messages
-   Data loading from standard input and remote loading, particularly useful for large data sources on remote hosts

!!! Note
    The following are important version compatibility restrictions between the EDB\*Loader client and the database server.

    -   When you invoke the EDB\*Loader program (called `edbldr`), you pass in parameters and directive information to the database server. We strongly recommend that you use the version 14 EDB\*Loader client (the edbldr program supplied with EDB Postgres Advanced Server 14) to load data only into version 14 of the database server. In general, use the same version for the EDB\*Loader client and database server.

    -   Using EDB\*Loader with connection poolers such as PgPool-II and PgBouncer isn't supported. EDB\*Loader must connect directly to EDB Postgres Advanced Server version 14. Alternatively, the following are some of the commands you can use for loading data through connection poolers:

        ```shell
        psql \copy
        jdbc copyIn
        psycopg2 copy_from
        ```
