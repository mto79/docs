EDB Postgres Advanced Server's `postgresql.conf` file includes a configuration parameter named `timed_statistics` that controls collecting timing data. The valid parameter values are `TRUE` or `FALSE`. The default value is `FALSE`.

`timed_statistics` is a dynamic parameter that you can modify in the `postgresql.conf` file or while a session is in progress. To enable DRITA, you must either:

-  Modify the `postgresql.conf` file, setting the `timed_statistics` parameter to `TRUE`.

-  Connect to the server with the EDB-PSQL client and invoke the command:

 Connect to the server with the EDB-PSQL client, and invoke the command:

```sql
SET timed_statistics = TRUE
```

After modifying the `timed_statistics` parameter, take a starting snapshot. A snapshot captures the current state of each timer and event counter. The server compares the starting snapshot to a later snapshot to gauge system performance.

Use the `edbsnap()` function to take the beginning snapshot:

```sql
edb=# SELECT * FROM edbsnap();
__OUTPUT__
    edbsnap
----------------------
 Statement processed.
(1 row)
```

Then, run the workload that you want to evaluate. When the workload is complete or at a strategic point during the workload, take another snapshot:

```sql
edb=# SELECT * FROM edbsnap();
__OUTPUT__
    edbsnap
----------------------
 Statement processed.
(1 row)
```

You can capture multiple snapshots during a session. Then, use the DRITA functions and reports to manage and compare the snapshots to evaluate performance information.
