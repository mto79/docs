title: "Starting and stopping EDB Postgres Advanced Server"
---

A service is a program that runs in the background and requires no user interaction (in fact, a service provides no user interface); a service can be configured to start at boot time, or manually on demand. Services are best controlled using the platform-specific operating system service control utility. Many of the EDB Postgres Advanced Server (EPAS) supporting components are services.

The following table lists the names of the services that control EPAS and services that control EPAS supporting components:

| EPAS component name | Windows service name                |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| EDB Postgres Advanced Server   | edb-as-14                                        |
| pgAgent                        | EDB Postgres Advanced Server Scheduling Agent |
| PgBouncer                      | edb-pgbouncer-1.14                               |
| Slony                          | edb-slony-replication-14                         |

You can use the command line or the Windows Services applet to control EPAS's database server and the services of EPAS's supporting components on a Windows host.
